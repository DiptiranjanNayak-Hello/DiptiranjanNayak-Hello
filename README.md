## Hey there! 👋  

I'm **Diptiranjan**, learning **Machine Learning**, **Cybersecurity**, and **AI-based tooling**.  
Right now, I'm studying ML, building small models, and experimenting with Kali Linux in a VirtualBox setup.

I mainly use **Python** and **Java**, and I'm exploring how AI can automate tasks and turn ideas into tools ⚡.  
I like challenging myself, experimenting freely, and learning as I build.

My goal is to create practical, real-world AI systems someday 🚀.
